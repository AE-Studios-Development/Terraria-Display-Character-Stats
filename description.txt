This mods displays most of your character statistics below your health bar / map. This mod can be useful for certain class builds or aiming for a specific stat value.

You can change the class of your offensive stats (see keybinds below) to the main vanilla classes such as generics (for stats bonus that applies to all classes) melee, ranged, magic and summoner or even to a custom modded damage class!

There is also "automatic", which sets the class to the weapon you are holding. If the held item doesn't have a damage class, it will be set to generics instead.

Visibility for specific stats can be toggled in the configs.
